# ðŸ”’ Password Checker  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This C++ program verifies password strength by checking against a set of security criteria. It enhances security by cross-referencing passwords against a **leaked passwords dataset**, ensuring users avoid compromised credentials.  

Key features:  
- **Strength validation** based on length, character variety, and complexity  
- **Cross-checking against leaked passwords** for security enhancement  
- **Efficient search** using binary search, vectors, and algorithms
